# Enumerables
> In this project, I implemented my version of Ruby’s enumerable methods.
I created a script file and added the new methods onto the existing Enumerable module.

The project requirements are [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/advanced-building-blocks#project-2-enumerable-methods).
